Oh, I beg you, can I follow?
Oh, I ask you, why not always?
Be the ocean, where I unravel
Be my only
Be the water where I'm wading
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild
I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow
I follow you, dark doom, honey
I follow you
He a message, I'm the runner
He the rebel
I'm the daughter waiting for you
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild
I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow
I follow you, dark doom, honey
I follow you
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild
I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow
I follow you, dark doom, honey
I follow you
